# Customizing Patches

Here's the [sample env](#sample-env) to help you. Reminder to check if you have [workflow permissions](#workflow-permission).

**Note - If you want to use or will be using `Automated` method to patch, please do not define anything inside `ENVS`. You are free to use `.env` file to do so.**

## Default

If you don't define anything in `.env` file or `ENVS` in `GitHub Secrets`, these configurations will be used:
- YouTube & YouTube Music apps will be patched
- With latest versions recommended by ReVanced
- Using latest resources provided by ReVanced
- With all patches included except for universal patches

**Note that _MicroG_ won't be released by default and you've to use `EXTRA_FILES` config for that to happen.**

## Configurations

1. **Officially** Supported values for **APP_NAME*** are listed under `Code` column [here](../../../changelogs/auto/docs/README.md#supported-apps).
    <br>Note that the page syncs itself with the usage of `PATCHES_JSON_DL` resources in the `.env` file.
    <br>The sources of original APKs are from one of these apkmirror, apkpure, uptodown & apksos sites. I'm not responsible for any damaged caused.

    caused.If you know any better/safe source to download clean. Open a discussion.

2. By default, script build the latest version mentioned in `patches.json` file.
3. Remember to download the **_Microg_**. Otherwise, you may not be able to open YouTube/YouTube Music.
4. <a id="patch-apps"></a>By default, tool will build only `youtube,youtube_music`. To build other apps supported by patching
   resources.Add the apps you want to build in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=<APP_NAME>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter,reddit
   ```
5. <a id="existing-downloaded-apks"></a>If APKMirror or other apk sources are blocked in your region or script
   somehow is unable to download from apkmirror. You can download apk manually from any source. Place them in
   `/apks` directory and provide environment variable in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format.
   ```ini
    EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=<Comma,Seperate,App,Name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
    EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=youtube,youtube_music
   ```
   If you add above. Script will not download the `YouTube` & `YouTube Music` apks from internet and expects an apk in
    `/apks` folder with names `youtube.apk` & `youtube_music.apk` (apk naming format - `<APP_NAME>.apk`) respectively.
6. <a id="personal-access-token"></a>If you run script again & again. You might hit GitHub API limit. In that case you can provide your Personal
    GitHub Access Token by adding a secret `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `GitHub secrets`.
7. <a id="global-resources"></a>You can provide Direct download to the resource to used for patching apps `.env` file
   or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format -
   ```ini
    GLOBAL_CLI_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli
    GLOBAL_PATCHES_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases/latest
    GLOBAL_PATCHES_JSON_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.190.0
    GLOBAL_INTEGRATIONS_DL=local://integrations.apk
   ```
   Resources downloaded from envs and will be used for patching for any **APP_NAME**.
   Unless provided different resource for the individual app.<br><br>
   Tool also support resource config at app level. You can patch A app with X resources while patching B with Y
   resources.
   This can be done by providing Direct download link for resources for app.<br>
   Example:
   ```ini
    YOUTUBE_CLI_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-cli
    YOUTUBE_PATCHES_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/latest
    YOUTUBE_PATCHES_JSON_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.187.1
    YOUTUBE_INTEGRATIONS_DL=local://inotia00-integrations.apk
   ```
   With the config tool will try to patch YouTube with resources from inotia00 while other global resource will used
   for patching other apps.<br>
   If you have want to provide resource locally in the apks folder. You can specify that by mentioning filename
   prefixed with `local://`.<br>
   _Note_ - The link provided must be direct DLs, unless they are from GitHub.
8. <a id="global-keystore-file-name"></a>If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by
   placing it inside `/apks` folder. And adding the filename of `keystore-file` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub

   ```ini
    YOUTUBE_KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=youtube.keystore
   ```
9. <a id="global-archs-to-build"></a>You can build only for a particular arch in order to get smaller apk files. This
   can be done with by adding comma separated `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` in `.env` file or `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the
   format.
   ```ini
    GLOABAL_ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,x86_64
   ```
   Tool also support configuring at app level.<br>

   Example:
   ```ini
    YOUTUBE_ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
   ```
   _Note_ -

    ```
    Example:
    ```ini
     EXTRA_FILES=https://github.com/inotia00/mMicroG/releases/latest@Mmicrog.apk,https://github.com/inotia00/VancedMicroG/releases/tag/v0.2.27.230755@Vmicrog.apk,https://github.com/revanced/revanced-integrations@integrations.apk
    ```
11. <a id="custom-exclude-patching"></a>If you want to exclude any patch. Set comma separated patch in `.env` file

    ```
    Example:
    ```ini

     YOUTUBE_MUSIC_EXCLUDE_PATCH=yt-music-is-shit
    ```
    Note -
    1. **All** the patches for an app are **included** by default.<br>
    2. Revanced patches are provided as space separated, make sure you type those in lowercase and **-** (hyphen or dash) separated here.

16. Configuration defined in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` will override the configuration in `.env` file. You can use this
    fact to define your normal configurations in `.env` file and sometimes if you want to build something different just
